# go-htmx-simple-calc


Hello this is a simple calculator that I made that also shows some of your previous calculations
*This does not save your histories though*

This is also just me messing around with Go, HTMX and templ:

**Go**: For managing my routes
**HTMX**: For managing the server sent events to just send back html instead of json
**templ**: used for templating the html

*Still gonna update the UI for the histories pages*
